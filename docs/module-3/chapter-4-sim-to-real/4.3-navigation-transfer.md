## Introduction to Navigation Transfer

Navigation transfer involves adapting path planning and locomotion algorithms developed in simulation to operate effectively on real robotic platforms. This process requires careful consideration of the differences between simulated and real-world navigation challenges, particularly for humanoid robots with complex dynamics and bipedal constraints.

### Navigation Domain Challenges

Navigation systems face unique challenges when transferring from simulation to reality:

- **Dynamic environment modeling**: Real-world environments are constantly changing
- **Sensor uncertainty**: Real sensors provide noisy and incomplete information
- **Robot dynamics**: Real robot dynamics may differ from simulation models
- **Bipedal constraints**: Humanoid robots have complex balance and locomotion requirements

## Nav2 Stack for Sim-to-Real Transfer

The Navigation2 (Nav2) stack provides several features that facilitate navigation transfer:

### Nav2 Architecture Components

The Nav2 stack includes components specifically designed for robust navigation:

- **Global Planner**: Generates optimal paths considering environmental constraints
- **Local Planner**: Executes real-time trajectory generation and obstacle avoidance
- **Controller**: Manages robot motion execution and feedback control
- **Recovery Behaviors**: Handles navigation failures and stuck situations

### Humanoid-Specific Navigation Considerations

Humanoid robots require specialized navigation approaches:

- **Bipedal locomotion planning**: Accounting for walking dynamics and balance
- **Step planning**: Generating footstep sequences for stable locomotion
- **Balance maintenance**: Ensuring center of mass remains within support polygon
