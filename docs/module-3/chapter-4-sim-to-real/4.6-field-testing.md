## Introduction to Field Testing for Sim-to-Real Transfer

Field testing represents the final validation stage in the sim-to-real transfer process, where robotic systems are evaluated in real-world environments to confirm their effectiveness, safety, and reliability. This chapter covers comprehensive methodologies for conducting field tests of systems developed in NVIDIA Isaac Sim and deployed using Isaac ROS and Nav2 on Jetson platforms.

### The Field Testing Process

Field testing involves systematic evaluation of robotic systems in operational environments:

- **Controlled deployment**: Gradual introduction to real environments
- **Performance validation**: Confirming system performance meets requirements
- **Safety verification**: Ensuring safe operation in real-world conditions
- **Robustness assessment**: Testing system resilience to real-world variations

## Preparing for Field Testing

### Pre-Deployment Validation

Before conducting field tests, comprehensive validation must be completed:

- **Simulation validation**: Confirming system performance in simulation
- **Laboratory testing**: Testing in controlled indoor environments
- **Safety system verification**: Ensuring all safety mechanisms function correctly
- **Performance benchmarking**: Establishing baseline performance metrics

### Risk Assessment and Mitigation

Conducting thorough risk assessment before field deployment:
